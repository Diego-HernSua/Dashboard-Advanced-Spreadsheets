### Information
The .xlsx file includes multiple sheets, such as the raw dataset, a processed dataset, and a dashboard, among others. Users can interact with pivot tables and other elements to extract and analyze relevant information. The dashboard is designed to present key insights and important data in a visually appealing and organized manner, making it easier to interpret and utilize the information effectively. Additionally, the file is structured to allow for dynamic exploration, enabling users to filter and manipulate the data to uncover specific trends and insights tailored to their needs.
